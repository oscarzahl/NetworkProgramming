# Communication protocol

This document describes the protocol used for communication between the different nodes in a greenhouse. 
Our application simulates a greenhouse with monitoring and control system using TCP connections.
It consists of multiple nodes representing sensors and actuators that communicate with a central server. 
The nodes send data to the server that are then sent to controlpanel nodes that visualize the data and offer
control off the actuators.

## Terminology
* Node - Represents a client in the system. Nodes include sensors, actuators, sensoractuator and controlpanel nodes.
* Server - The central entity that coordinates the communication and manages connections between nodes.
* Client - Any nodes connected to the server.
* Sensor - A device which senses the environment and describes it with a integer value. Examples: temperature sensor, humidity sensor.
* Actuator - A device which can influence the environment based on control signals, such as turning on/off a fan.
* Sensor and actuator node - a computer which has direct access to a set of sensors, a set of
  actuators and is connected to the Internet.
* Control-panel node - a device connected to the Internet which visualizes status of sensor and
  actuator nodes and sends control commands to them.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) - A graphical interface where users of the system can interact with
  it.

## The underlying transport protocol

We use TCP(Transsmission Control Protocol) as the transport layer protocol because in a greenhouse we want
to ensure reliable and ordered delivery of data between nodes and the server.
We used port number 12345; This ensures that all nodes and the server communicate consistently on the same port.

## The architecture

TODO - show the general architecture of your network. Which part is a server? Who are clients? 
Do you have one or several servers? Perhaps include a picture here. 

We have one server, and the clients are all the nodes that connect to the server.

Clients and Server:
Clients: All nodes connected to server
Server: The central coordinator of communication between nodes

Clients (nodes):
Sensors: Measure the enviroment
Actuators: Performs actions if it gets the command
Server: Manages sensor data and actuator commands
Control Panel: Visualizes the data for the user, and lets user control actuators


## The flow of information and events

TODO - describe what each network node does and when. Some periodic events? Some reaction on 
incoming packets? Perhaps split into several subsections, where each subsection describes one 
node type (For example: one subsection for sensor/actuator nodes, one for control panel nodes).

Sensor nodes: Periodically send data tot he server.
Acutator nodes: Send status updates to the server and receive commands from the server.
Control panel nodes: Sends actuator states to server when pressed 
Server: broadcasts commands to actuators and sends updates to the control panel.

## Connection and state

TODO - is your communication protocol connection-oriented or connection-less? Is it stateful or 
stateless? 

The protocol uses TCP connection which is connection oriented, The clients need to be connected to the server to be able 
to send or recieve data from the server, the communication is stateful. 


## Types, constants

TODO - Do you have some specific value types you use in several messages? They you can describe 
them here.

The "State" of an actuator is held in the boolean state, being true/false.

## Message format

TODO - describe the general format of all messages. Then describe specific format for each 
message type in your protocol.

Message format:
- Sensor Messages: SENSOR:<nodeId>:<sensorType>=<currentReading unit>
   Example: SENSOR:1:temperature=27.5Â°C,humidity=50%
- Actuator Messages: ACTUATOR:<nodeId>:<actuatorId>:<actuatorType>=<state>
   Example: ACTUATOR:2:3:fan=true,4:heater=false

  These messages are sent and parsed on the server where they are broadcasted to and visualized in the control panel. 

### Error messages

TODO - describe the possible error messages that nodes can send in your system.

If there is an unexpected message format it logs the issue as "invalid sensor/actuator data format" the message is ingored and is not sent.

## An example scenario

TODO - describe a typical scenario. How would it look like from communication perspective? When 
are connections established? Which packets are sent? How do nodes react on the packets? An 
example scenario could be as follows:
1. A sensor node with ID=1 is started. It has a temperature sensor, two humidity sensors. It can
   also open a window.
2. A sensor node with ID=2 is started. It has a single temperature sensor and can control two fans
   and a heater.
3. A control panel node is started.
4. Another control panel node is started.
5. A sensor node with ID=3 is started. It has a two temperature sensors and no actuators.
6. After 5 seconds all three sensor/actuator nodes broadcast their sensor data.
7. The user of the first-control panel presses on the button "ON" for the first fan of
   sensor/actuator node with ID=2.
8. The user of the second control-panel node presses on the button "turn off all actuators".


Scenario: The temperature in the greenhouse rises above a safe threshold
1. Sensor Node: Sends data temperature and other data to the server
2. Server: The server processes the data and sends it to the control panel.
3. User: The user sees the current temperature off the greenhouse and uses the control panel to turn on Fans
4. Control Panel: Sends which actuator on which node that has a changed state to the server.
5. Server: Processes the message and sends tchange state to the actuator node.
6. Actuator Node: Recieves the command and activates the fan.
7. Control Panel: Updates the UI with sensor readings and actuator states.

## Reliability and security

TODO - describe the reliability and security mechanisms your solution supports.

Using TCP ensures reliable delivery of data, preventing packet loss from nodes to server and back.
