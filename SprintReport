Our group took this course last year, we are retaking the course this semester and we were not signed up for the IDATA2304 course on Blackboard.
Since we did not get the project description until Nov 26, we did not have time to work in Sprints.


### Distributed Task

We mostly work on the same things sometimes on different branches, when either accomplished the goal we would work from their solution.
There are still some ways we split responsobility:

Jeremy: 
  - Responsible for parsing messages on the Server
  - Responsible for sending correct messages out from the Server

Oscar:
  - Implemented communication between nodes and Server
  - Responsible for getting node readings on ControlPanel
  - Responsible for stop communication
